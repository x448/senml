# Go Cover - GitHub Actions Workflow
# Author: Montgomery Edwards⁴⁴⁸ (github.com/x448)
# This workflow checks if code coverage satisfies the required minimum.
# The require minimum is specified in the workflow name. This keeps badge.svg and verified minimum in sync.
# Example steps:
# 1. Change workflow name from "cover 100%" to "cover ≥92.5%". Script will automatically use 92.5%.  
# 2. Change README.md to use the new path to badge.svg because the path includes the workflow name.

  # Verify minimum coverage is reached using `go test -short -cover` on latest-ubuntu with default version of Go.
  cover:
    name: Coverage

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Go Coverage
      run: go test -short -cover | python -c "import os,re,sys; cover_rpt = sys.stdin.read(); print(cover_rpt); min_cover = float(re.findall(r'\d*\.\d+|\d+', os.environ['GITHUB_WORKFLOW'])[0]); cover = float(re.findall(r'\d*\.\d+|\d+', cover_rpt)[0]); sys.exit(1) if (cover > 100) or (cover < min_cover) else sys.exit(0)"

      # This doesn't check senmlCat or senmlServer because they have no tests.
